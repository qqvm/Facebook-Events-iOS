Facebook Events allows you to discover events from Facebook platform.

Note that Facebook currently has a bug with birthday data, that's why December has no items.

You can install this application in two ways:
1. Compile it yourself and install through Xcode
2. Resign ipa file using such tools as [AltServer](https://github.com/rileytestut/AltStore) or [iOS App Signer](https://github.com/DanTheMan827/ios-app-signer) (both open source) and then install it via AltServer or Xcode.
